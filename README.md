# MariaAnna Page Layout

This is one-page layout that I made, trying to match as close as possible the PSD project. The PSD file was taken from [Weekly WebDev Challenge](https://www.facebook.com/groups/940002776068923) and this specific one is a task number 9 and can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bw2hu70L5Ye_eDZUbnRTNWQ3Qlk).<br>
As far as methodologies and techniques are concerned, I used SCSS, BEM, mostly Flexbox for positioning (except the photo gallery, where I used CSS Grid) and vanilla JS for sticky navbar, toggling nav menu for mobile and for slider.<br>
The site is fully responsive. Feel free to test it on your desktop or mobile device at [https://andrzejruga.github.io/mariaanna/](https://andrzejruga.github.io/mariaanna/).
